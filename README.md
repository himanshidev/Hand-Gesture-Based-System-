# ✋ Hand Detection & Gesture Control System

An AI-powered **gesture recognition system** designed to enable **touchless human-computer interaction**. The system integrates **American Sign Language (ASL) recognition**, a **virtual keyboard**, and an **AI-powered mathematics module**, allowing users to **communicate, type, and solve problems without physical touch**.


## 📌 **Why This Project?**

Traditional input devices such as the mouse and keyboard are increasingly being replaced with **natural, intuitive, and hygienic alternatives**. Gesture-based systems provide:

* **Accessibility** for individuals with impairments.
* **Hygienic interaction** in healthcare and public systems.
* **Immersive experiences** in AR/VR and education.



## 🛠 **Project Journey**

### 🔹 **Minor Project (Foundation Stage)**

The work began with a gesture-control minor project, which explored fundamental applications of hand tracking:

* **Finger Calculation** – Detecting finger counts for numerical input.
* **Volume Control** – Adjusting system volume using hand gestures.
* **Basic Sign Language Recognition** – Recognizing simple signs for communication.

This stage validated **real-time gesture tracking** using **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe**, proving the feasibility of touchless interaction.

### 🔹 **Major Project (Advanced System)**

The minor project evolved into a comprehensive major project with a modular and scalable design, extending functionality to:

* **ASL Gesture Recognition** – Translating sign language into text.
* **Virtual Keyboard** – Contactless typing using gestures.
* **AI-Powered Mathematics** – Solving math problems by interpreting hand-drawn numbers and operators.

This transition expanded the system from **basic control** to a **complete gesture-based interaction platform** for accessibility, education, and healthcare.


## ⚙️ **System Architecture**

1. **Capture** live video feed via webcam. 🎥
2. **Preprocess** frames using OpenCV. 🖼
3. **Detect** 21 hand landmarks with Mediapipe. ✋
4. **Classify** gestures using deep learning models. 🧠
5. **Map** gestures to actions such as typing, ASL translation, or math solving. ⚡


## 🚀 **Features**

* **Real-time gesture recognition** with low latency (<30ms).
* **Contactless interaction** ensuring hygienic use.
* **Scalable, modular design** evolving from minor → major project.
* **High accuracy** across lighting conditions and environments.
* **Future-ready** and extensible for new gesture-based applications.


## 💻 **Tech Stack**

* **Python 3.x**
* **OpenCV** – video processing
* **Mediapipe** – hand landmark detection
* **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – gesture classification
* **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** – data handling and visualization


## 🔮 **Future Scope**

* Cross-platform support: Linux, macOS, mobile, and web. 🌐
* Gesture-based **virtual mouse**. 🖱
* Smart home and IoT integration. 🏠
* Gesture-driven **VR/AR gaming**. 🎮
* Adaptive deep learning for more diverse gestures. 🤖
